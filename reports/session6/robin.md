Today we focused on assembling the drone by glueing the parts together, this was pretty difficult as the instructions were not so clear.
Then i studied the register map of the mpu6050 module to get the DMP ( digital motion processor ) working. i was successful as i've now got full 
resolution data on the rotations of the drone. We took the decision to assemble another drone, diy made to backup the project and ensure that one of them 
will fly.
