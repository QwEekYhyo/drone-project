During last week, i got the SBUS working by using a logic inverter and retro-engineering the protocol (it is very difficult to find ressources online as it seems to be a very
obscure protocole). So i now have access to all the 16 channels in the blink of an eye via a 100.000bit/s serial connection. 
I did upgrade to an arduino mega as i need more serial ports for all the sensors.
I started to develop the barebone structure of the code for the arduino onboard the drone and i did make an electronic diagram of the drone. I would have linked it if
only i knew how to do it. 
Next in the list is getting all the 5 PIDs working (throttle altitude pitch yaw roll) but i can't tune them without the drone fully assembled
With my partner, we decided that if the 3d printed plane doesn't suit our needs, we will 3d print custom made segments for the wings and build a drone of our own.
Once all the sensors are hooked up to the arduino, i will connect the data feed to our telemetry software for further testing.
