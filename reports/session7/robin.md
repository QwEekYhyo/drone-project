Today was very productiva as we almost finished assembling the drone. During the week, i also bought a ton of extruded foam to build a second prototype.
The first 3d printed prototype will most certainly be the one we show on the last class, but the second will be a more versatile and capable design.
As far as the code goes, i've started to setup everything in the main program and Drone class, and group up all the previous codes into one. 
After initial tests, the code side of the project is ready for plug and play, man-controlled flight. We won't be flying the drone before the deadline 
as it would be almost impossible to make another one in this short amount of time; but we hope to test it afterward. 
The autonomous flight code is being developped by myself and will be ready for the presentation in a barely tested and highly WIP state but 
i think it will be interesting to show it still as a proof of concept.
