Today i worked on the gps module which is essential for our project as it will be our main positioning system. I got it working after a while, 
because i had to retro engineer the connections of the module and figure out the baudrate as it wasn't indicated on the module.
I got it working with a library called TinyGPS++. I also got all the servos and the main engine hooked up. Next thing on the list, i need to make custom cables and solder
a perf board for the arduino so that we have a safe and compact connection for all the sensors and moving parts.
