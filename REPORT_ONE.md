## Session 1

### Romain

I have created a `Motor` class that can control brushless motors, and I have tested it on the real motor. This Class is capable of precisely driving the motor with microsecond precision wich is good for subtle throttle changes.

### Robin

I have soldered the ESCs with the 2400Kv Bldc Motor as well as tested the motor with the stabilized alimentation. This setup will later be used in combination with my PID program to test and tune PID's for stable flight
