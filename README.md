# Drone project

## Description

We intend to build an efficient and reliable way to perform ground attacks operations with minimum cost. For that purpose, we want to use an airplane type drone, fully autonomous, capable of delivering a small warhead from takeoff to target in a safe manner. The drone shall be able to perform evasive maneuvers to escape any surface to air point defense as well as following a non-linear path to target in order to keep the surprise factor.

## Specifications

* Fixed-wing drone
* 10km range with telemetry data
* Autonomous fire and forget system
* Multiple plug and plug solutions for interfacing different units (cameras, sensors, rockets, ...)
* 1kg weight and easy to carry
* 30min autonomy
